    <p>Prior  to  the  IT  revolution,  weather  information  was  typically  broadcast through non-electronic and electronic media. <br>However, through the advent of technology, populations are now able to receive routine weather information through  media other  than the  traditional sources  of television  and  radio.<br> These media channels include various forms of computing devices, such as personal computers, laptops, tablets, phablets and smartphones.<br> In view of the growth, the ever-increasing penetration and adoption  of smartphones, coupled with the mobility of societal lifestyle patterns, the „smartphone‟ would seem to be well suited  as a device for consumer acceptance of weather information by means of weather apps. <br> As part of a larger study into the acceptance, trust and value of weather apps by smartphone users, a number of key consumer-based insights are illustrated within this paper. <br>These insights may have implications for both marketers of smartphones and developers of weather apps.<br></p>
